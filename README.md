# Ohio-Senate-Funding
This repository visualizes the campaign funding for the Ohio Senate race between Tim Ryan and J.D. Vance. 

# Documentation of the project, end-to-end
- Need to scrape data from FEC and possibly opensecrets.
  - Need to establish *where* the money is coming from
  - Assign zipcode / county to contribution, *out-of-state* for others
    - Might be easy to extend and break down the *out-of-state* category

- Once GEOJson file is created, pipe into Svelte frontend and javascript backend?
  - Nodejs for backend
  - Need to learn svelte for frontend presentation
  - The notebooks will ETL the data, but what JS packages will show the visualizations?
  - Github pages?

- Create meaningful context, this might be difficult, need to learn some about journalistic writing / ethics.
